This is the UnQLite extension for Tcl using the Tcl Extension
Architecture (TEA).  For additional information on UnQLite see

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

	$ cd tclunqlite
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install
	
If you need setup directory containing tcl configuration (tclConfig.sh),
below is an example:

	$ cd tclunqlite
	$ ./configure --with-tcl=/opt/activetcl/lib
	$ make
	$ make install

UnQLite is threadsafe and re-entrant (but it is not the default behavior).
To compile UnQLite with threading support, define the UNQLITE_ENABLE_THREADS
compile-time directive.

So at v0.2.5, I add UNQLITE_ENABLE_THREADS flag in configure.ac.
If you don't need enable this, modified configure.ac to remove this flag,
from TEA_ADD_CFLAGS([-DUNQLITE_ENABLE_THREADS]) to TEA_ADD_CFLAGS([]),
then do autoconf to create a new configure file.
below is an example:

	$ cd tclunqlite
	$ autoconf
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install
    
    
WINDOWS BUILD
=============

The recommended method to build extensions under windows is to use the
Msys + Mingw build process. This provides a Unix-style build while
generating native Windows binaries. Using the Msys + Mingw build tools
means that you can use the same configure script as per the Unix build
to create a Makefile.
